Problem Statement:
The task is to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections.

The goal is to build an IDS to classify attacks as malicious or normal connections. Here is the entire implementation in four steps:-
i.   Load the dataset and apply pre-processing.
ii.  Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
iii. Train and test following classifiers - Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive bayes, Logistics Regression, SVM, KNN.
iv.  Make predictions using ensemble techniques.
